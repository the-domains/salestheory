<p>For our purposes we are going to focus on #2 of the above definition, but just so you know we do love the small fragments of bread, especially those coating the outside of a chicken tender or slice of eggplant. :) When I personally think of breadcrumbs I imagine the children's story of Hansel and Gretel. Two young people leaving themselves a trail of breadcrumbs so that they can find their way back to where they began. You know how the story goes though, they get trapped by a house made of candy and the witch that lives inside tries to bake them into a pie. This is the basic premise of our Breadcrumb strategy.</p><p>Breadcrumbs for us is not about finding your way back to where you began, or a strategy for not getting lost. The Breadcrumb strategy is about leading your prospect to you and the solution, product, job or event you have to offer. It is a combination of marketing and sales and allows each person to build a solid funnel of highly qualified prospects while building strong relationships at the same time. Most of todays clients don't want to be sold to and I am sure you can relate. No one wants to be bombarded with sales pitches, marketing material, phone calls, emails, or worse. </p><p>Todays clients are savvy and smart and they have a wealth of information about anything at their fingertips. A buyer will research for hours before they narrow down their list of potential "buys" before they ever reach out for help. So how do you get in front of your prospects "buying process" so that they gradually lean towards you and what you have to offer? The answer is Breadcrumbs. There is so much information that you can put in front of a prospect before you actually ever email, call, or meet them in person. </p><p>Social media gives you a huge advantage that every buyer and seller has at their disposal...nothing new here, I know. But think about it like this, if a prospect sees your name, face, title, tagline, company name, shared media or thoughts - do you think any of it will stick in their mind? What if you slowly feed this material out to them in a nonintrusive way? What if you do this many times over the course of a month to 10's-100's of people in the same target company per week? From our experience and the experience of people that have followed the Breadcrumb strategy will tell you that the prospects start contacting you and the ones that don't are more apt to connect and converse with you to start building a relationship. The other plus here is that almost every single prospect will respect you more for not cold-selling them on what you have to offer. You give the prospect the opportunity to pick and choose if they want to engage you in any way but once they engage you, even just a little bit, you have a healthy start to a relationship to leverage for a solid sales process.</p><p>Breadcrumbs arms followers with a strategy that includes research methods, social media outreach methods, connect request templates, email templates, voicemail templates and discusses the psychology behind why they work in todays world of prospecting, sales, and marketing. In our next article we will discuss the research and social media outreach parts of the Breadcrumb strategy. We love your feedback and we truly hope that you provide us honest feedback as you read along and implement our strategy. Remember, we are all practicing our crafts in this ever changing world and we look forward to evolving with you.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The SalesTheory Team</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="40"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="42"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="43"><span data-reactid="44"><!-- react-empty: 45 --><h2 data-reactid="46"><a data-reactid="47">SalesTheory</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="49"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="50"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="51"></div></section></div></div>
